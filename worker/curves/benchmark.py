"""Make a slop score mean something: rank it against a FROZEN reference distribution.

    uv run python scripts/benchmark.py build multihacksfinalv9.jsonl --version 2026.1
    uv run python scripts/benchmark.py rank 120
    uv run python scripts/benchmark.py rank --results run.jsonl --app theirapp.vercel.app

A deduction-only score has no natural scale. "120" is uninterpretable the way "a resting heart rate of 58"
is uninterpretable without a population. `build` casts the ruler from a corpus run; `rank` places one app on
it and names the band.

Four rules the design commits to, each because the obvious shortcut is wrong:

* Rank PER AXIS over the sub-population where that axis was APPLICABLE. Totals are not comparable across
  apps: one app's score was summed over 60 applicable probes and another's over 30, so ranking raw totals
  partly ranks "how much surface did you even have". An app with no reachable auth surface is not thereby
  secure, and it must not out-rank an app that had one and got it right.
* FREEZE and version the curve. A credential has to be reproducible: if the reference drifts, the same
  unchanged app earns a different rank next month. Rolling percentiles are fine for a live dashboard, never
  for a badge.
* Report the POPULATION with the number. "p82" alone is a lie of omission; "p82 of 1110 live hackathon apps,
  2026.1" is a claim someone can check.
* Never percentile a catastrophe. "You leaked a live key, but so did 30% of apps, so you're p70" is exactly
  backwards. Absolute-gate classes are reported as gates, whatever the rank says.

Ties on the raw score are broken, best to worst, by: whether a catastrophe fired (clean first), then how much
worst-case slop the app DEFENDED (`slop_potential`, the post-damped score it would carry if every applicable
probe had fired, reconstructed so it damps identically to the real score), then the breadth of probe categories
exercised. Two apps at the same number are not equal: one may have defended a large surface, another barely
presented one. The curve stores the full empirical distribution, not only landmarks, so the overall percentile
is exact and honours these keys.

Excluded from the reference: anchors (deliberately-vulnerable calibration targets would drag the curve),
--probe subset runs (their slop is a fraction of a full grade), dead URLs, DNF/non-functional apps
(ranked below every working app, never rescued to a flattering percentile), entry-challenge withholds
(a bot-interstitial on the first fetch -> nothing graded, scored 0), and canvas-shell hosts like Streamlit
(the probe only ever sees the framework's uniform shell, so the grade is the framework, not the app).
